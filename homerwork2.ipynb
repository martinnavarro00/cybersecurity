    "### Homework 2\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Suppose a password is chosen as a concatenation of seven lower-case dictionary words. Each word is selected uniformly at random from a dictionary of size 50,000. An example of such a password is \"mothercathousefivenextcrossroom\". How many bits of entropy does this have?\n",
    "* In cyber security Entropy is given by the following equation: $$\\ Entropy = log_2 (Number of posible calculations)$$\n",
    "* In this case the Number of posible calculations is: $$\\ 50,000^7$$ since there are seven words in the password.\n",
    "* $$\\ Entropy = 7* log_2(50,000) $$\n",
    "* $$\\ Entropy = 7* 15.60 $$\n",
    "* $$\\ Entropy = 109.26 bits $$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Consider an alternative scheme where a password is chosen as a sequence of 10 random alphanumeric characters (including both lower-case and upper-case letters). An example is \"dA3mG67Rrs\". How many bits of entropy does this have?\n",
    "* In this case we have to consider that we have 26 lower case letter, 26 upper case letters and 10 numbers(from 0-9). 26+26+10=62\n",
    "* $$\\ Entropy = log_2(62^10) $$\n",
    "* $$\\ Entropy = 10 * log_2(62)$$\n",
    "* $$\\ Entropy = 59.53 bits $$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Which password is better, the one from 1. or 2.?\n",
    "* In this case password number 1 is better since it has a higher entropy than password number 2, meaning it is more difficult to break.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Design a data verification system using hash functions. Explain the steps involved in the process.\n",
    "* select hash function->Hash original data->store hash value->send data with hash value obtained->receive message->hash recalculation with hash function->compared values with the one calculated and the one received-> verify authenticity.\n",
    "2. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using hash functions for data verification.\n",
    "##### Advantages\n",
    "* Data integrity: Provide a way to verify the integrity of data. By having a key and a hash function a receiver can very if the messages has been modified. \n",
    "* Efficient: Hash functions are computationally efficient. It can verify data very fast.\n",
    "* Complexity: It is difficult to attacker to reverse-engineer a hash function making them also very secure.\n",
    "##### Disadvantages\n",
    "* Irreversable: this can be an advantage but also a disavantge since they are imposible to recover data.\n",
    "* Limited: Since hash functions provide a fixed sized output value attacker can precomputed diferent posible outputs values until they found a match.\n",
    "3. Provide an example of a real-world application where a data verification system using hash functions is used.\n",
    "* An example of real world application in this case is digital signatures where the receiver can verify using hash functions calculation its authenticity of the message that is sented joint with the signature.\n",
    "* Other example is blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define what a Message Authentication Code (MAC) is and how it is used in cryptography.\n",
    "* MAC is a technique used in cryptography that asures authenticity and integrity of a message between the sender and the receiver. The sender generates the MAC using a secret key and include the MAC in the message. The receiver also generate a MAC using the same secret key the sender used and compares it to verify the message has not been interceped by anyone else.\n",
    "2. Explain the process of generating and verifying a MAC.\n",
    "* To start the process both the sender and the receiver must share a confidential secret that is only shared between both of them. Then the sender use a hash function and the secret key to genereted the MAC and is send to the receiver.\n",
    "* The receiver get the MAC, the message and the key. Then using the hash function the receiver uses the key to calculate the MAC from the message received.\n",
    "* Finally the receiver compared the MAC he calculated and the MAC he received in order to determine its autenticity.\n",
    "3. Discuss the importance of using MACs in secure communication systems.\n",
    "* MACs are used to verifiy the authenticity and integrity of the message and the people who sends them. By having a matching MAC the receiver can verifty that the message is not alterate and can verify that the sender is indeed true.\n",

    "## Exercise 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the values of p = 17 and q = 23, generate a pair of keys for RSA.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $$\\ p=17,q=23$$\n",
    "* $$\\ n=p*q=391$$\n",
    "* $$\\ Ï†(n)=(p-1)*(q-1)= 352$$\n",

    "## Exercise 5:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Design a public key infrastructure (PKI) system. Explain the components and their roles in the system.\n",
    "<img src=\"./pkiStructure.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Discuss the advantages and challenges of implementing a PKI system.\n",
    "#### Advantages\n",
    "* PKI provide security throught data encryption. Guarantees authentication and condidentiality.\n",
    "* It is scalable.\n",
    "* Provide Non-repudation. Meaning that with the use of certificates the user can not deny their involvement in a transaction or comunication.\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "* It is complex to implement and manage\n",
    "* Mainting it and having a PKI infrastructure can be expensive.\n",
    "* Can be vulnerable when there is not a correct key and certificate management.\n",
    "3. Provide an example of a real-world application where a PKI system is used.\n",
    "* One of the most know real world application of PKI is in web sources. This is the use of SSL protocols. It is applied when someone enters a webpage that has \"https://\" in which the browser establish a secure connection.\n",

    "Design a system for digital signatures based on public-key cryptography. Explain the steps involved in the process and the role of each component.\n",
